Dynamic Compnents:
--make this only available to admin users
look at the game rules and create react components based on how teams can score
add a page to dynamically add react components to the scouting page (upper: counter, climb: timer)
dynamically configure Firebase schema to fit the the scouting fields (no scripting to calculate scores, that will be
calculated client side after Firebase queries)

User Management:
Initialize users with temporary  passwords and let them change their passwords
Designate admin (Suhas, Justus) roles and Scouter roles
Be able to delete and add users easily --check for admin user

Firebase Schema:
After setting compnents - name the schema and set it as active (name it the competition name) -- a Firebase
collection of the same name will be created.

Admin Page:
Have an admin page from home where you can configure the schema and add/delete users


disregard zero climb times and certain calculations
